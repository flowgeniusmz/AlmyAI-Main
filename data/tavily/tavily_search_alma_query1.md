Alma Hybrid offers physicians a comprehensive solution to utilize each best-in-class laser independently or for the very first time, customize the treatment pattern by combining both wavelengths. Alma Hybrid is commercially available in U.S.\n"unmatched...flexibility and customization"- Jeffrey Hsu, MD\xa0 Dermatologist\nBehind every advancement in laser skin resurfacing the clinical endpoint has been centered on optimizing results with less downtime. Alma Hybrid provides physicians a new treatment option that further closes this gap between results and downtime by combining an ablative CO2 injury alongside a non-ablative 1570 nm injury. This method of delivery known as HyGrid™, introduces an entirely new injury pattern unseen with any other device on the market.\xa0"The combination of an ablative CO2 laser and a non-ablative 1570 nm laser in one platform already makes Alma Hybrid unique. But the unmatched level of flexibility and customization makes this device the ultimate resurfacing tool," said Jeffrey Hsu, M.D., a dermatologist at Oak Dermatology, in the greater Chicago, Illinois area. "I can fly through a full-face skin resurfacing treatment in 15 minutes with HyPer™\xa0delivery and the synergy of CO2 and 1570 nm gives me the best possible combination of effectiveness and safety." Alma Hybrid is the only device to feature high performance delivery known as HyPer™.\xa0In HyPer delivery, an ablative CO2 injury is followed by a non-ablative 1570 nm injury in random pattern, significantly reducing treatment time and improving patient experience.\n"Alma has a long-established track record of developing radically innovative solutions such as Alma Hybrid to the market," said Keith Adams, President of Alma, North America. "We\'re committed in advancing our industry forward by investing in essential treatment categories that our customers and their patients depend on, like skin resurfacing."\nAbout Alma\nAlma is a global innovator of Laser, Light-based, Radiofrequency, Plasma and Ultrasound solutions for the aesthetic and surgical markets.

Listening closely to what our customers need, and what their customers want, has become a major factor in the technology we develop and the transformation we’re creating together. This, in a nutshell, is our story.\nAs a company, our focus has always been on creating outstanding technology. Over the years, we have come to understand that in order to create TRULY outstanding technology, it needs to address the role our platforms play in our customer’s practice, and more so, in the lives of their patients. As such, we have re-focused the conversation, moving from just technology to technology that enhances people’s wellbeing. The result is visible in the way we operate, putting people first, and daring to lead the way in technology, knowledge, and attitude.\nWe look at life in this modern world and the pace at which things move through the eyes of doctors and patients. We make sure treatments are safe, short, and effective. , as is expected in a modern world, and we keep our finger on the pulse, to ensure we continue to deliver.\nOver decades of work, research, and development, we have accumulated the knowledge and clinical expertise to develop over 60 patents that have been put into practice in numerous machines and treatments. We also believe in sharing the knowledge, and passing it on to practitioners, through our academy, training days, and support staff. In this way, we can be certain that those delivering the treatments are at their peak, confident\xa0 that they have the skills and knowledge required to provide the best, most effective treatments.\nAnd all this is possible because we dare. Dare to lead the industry, rather than following. Dare to set the standards. Dare to say it like it is, to do things differently. We want to make a difference in people’s lives. A real one.
