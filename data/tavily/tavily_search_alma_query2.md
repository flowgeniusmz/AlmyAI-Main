The Market Size and Forecasts are Provided in Terms of Value (USD Million) for the Above Segments.\nAesthetic Laser Market Size\nMajor Players\n*Disclaimer: Major Players sorted in no particular order\nNeed a report that reflects how COVID-19 has impacted this market and its growth?\nAesthetic Laser Market Analysis\nThe Aesthetic Lasers Market size is estimated at USD 2.96 billion in 2024, and is expected to reach USD 4.59 billion by 2029, growing at a CAGR of 9.18% during the forecast period (2024-2029).\nLasers are gaining significant attention in the aesthetic devices industry, as several procedures are performed using lasers. Some widely known and performed laser procedures include laser resurfacing, hair removal, and vascular and pigmented lesions. Laser resurfacing helps reduce facial wrinkles, blemishes, acne scars, and skin irregularities. These treatments can be performed on the face, neck, chest, arms, and hands. Some well-known companies, such as Lumenis, Alma Lasers, and Cynosure, provide aesthetic lasers or workstations that offer laser resurfacing, hair removal, and treatment of lesions.\nVarious lasers, including CO2, erbium, pulsed dye, and fractional pulsed dye, are tuned for multiple skin conditions and skin types in laser skin resurfacing. When doing a laser skin resurfacing procedure, a CO2 laser is typically utilized to remove damaged surface skin from the entire face. The report from the International Society of Plastic Surgery (ISAPS) published in 2021 stated that 35% of women who have previously undergone at least one cosmetic surgery or minimally invasive procedure anticipate spending much more on treatments in 2021 than they did in 2020. Owing to the increasing laser procedures, the market studied is expected to witness substantial growth in the coming years.\nSimilarly, new product launches from key players are one of the major factors propelling market growth. For instance, in June 2022, Cynosure announced the launch of the PicoSure Pro laser device, the latest upgrade to the PicoSure platform. The first and only 755 nm picosecond laser has received FDA clearance. PicoSure Pro delivers energy in a trillionth of a second using pressure rather than heat to treat undesirable pigmentation and rejuvenate skin on all skin types. Furthermore, in March 2022, Cynosure entered a distribution partnership with JeisysMedical KK in Japan. Under the terms of the agreement, JeisysMedical will have exclusive distribution rights for key premier products within Cynosure's energy-based laser portfolio, including hair removal devices in Japan. Owing to such developments in laser devices, the market studied is expected to witness healthy growth in the coming years.\nHowever, the social stigma associated with cosmetic treatments and the high cost of the procedures is expected to hinder the market growth.\nAesthetic Laser Market Trends\nHair Removal Segment Holds Significant Market Share and is Expected to Continue the Same Trend Over the Forecast Period\nLaser hair removal is one of the highly popular aesthetic procedures. To treat various skin problems and remove unwanted hair, dermatologists routinely use intense pulsed light (IPL) and laser devices. While alexandrite and diode lasers are widely employed, neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd: YAG) has the lowest overall hair eradication efficiency. However, Nd: YAG is frequently utilized for pigmented skin due to its greater wavelength.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the demand for online purchases of aesthetic home-based products increased significantly worldwide. For instance, a cross-sectional survey conducted to evaluate the practices related to the use of light-based home-use hair removal devices was published in January 2022 in the International Journal of Trichology (Hair Research Society of India). The survey results showed a significant rise in the adoption of light-based home-use hair removal devices among the population during the outbreak.\nAs per the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ISAPS), 1,837,052 hair removal procedures and 240,213 micro-ablative resurfacing procedures were done worldwide in 2020. It has been observed that despite the COVID-19 outbreak, the number of these non-surgical laser-based aesthetic procedures increased drastically compared to that of the previous year. As a result of this growing demand for procedures, there has been advancing research on hair removal procedures with the help of various devices available in the market. For instance, in September 2021, doctors and researchers at the SL Aesthetic Clinic in Singapore launched an innovative new laser hair removal treatment method using a medical-grade Fotona Laser. Hence, with the innovation in treatment, there is a growing demand for advanced lasers used for hair removal propelling the segment growth.\nHence, owing to the aforementioned factors, the hair removal segment is expected to grow significantly during the forecast period.\nNorth America is Expected to Dominate the Aesthetic Lasers Market over the Forecast period\nNorth America is expected to hold a significant share of the aesthetic lasers market. Growth is attributed to the presence of key market players, the increasing number of aesthetic laser procedures, and the high adoption of minimally invasive devices in the region.\nUnited States is one of the key countries in the North American region with a significant market share. According to the ISAPS report published in 2021, around 4.67 million cosmetic treatments were carried out in the United States in 2020, among which 3.18 million were minimally invasive operations, while 1.49 million were aesthetic surgical procedures. According to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons report published in 2021, around 15.6 million cosmetic treatments and 6.8 million reconstructive procedures were carried out in the country in 2020. The high number of aesthetic procedures indicates the demand for aesthetic devices in the country, which is considerably high and contributes mainly to market growth.\nFurthermore, owing to the increasing demand, market players are focusing on new product developments and launches to expand their market share in the country. For instance, Alma Lasers introduced Alma PrimeX in April 2021, the top non-invasive platform for skin tightening and body reshaping. In Addition, Solta Medical business, one of the global leaders in the medical aesthetics market, launched the next-generation Clear + Brilliant laser in the United States in March 2021. The emergence of such advanced lasers is accelerating the demand for laser treatments. Hence, the market for aesthetic lasers in the region is projected to have significant market growth over the forecast period.\nAesthetic Laser Industry Overview\nThe aesthetic lasers market is moderately competitive and is expected to be dominated by some major players. Some of the major players in the global aesthetic lasers market are Alma Lasers, Candela Medical, Cutera, Cynosure, IRIDEX Corp., Jeisys Corporation, Lumenis, Sciton, Inc., etc. Aesthetic Lasers have revolutionized the beauty industry, providing significant results with minimal invasiveness.\nAesthetic Laser Market Leaders\nCynosure\nLumenis\nCandela Medical\nBausch Health Companies Inc.

Dermatologists are now able to treat skin conditions that were once considered incurable. On top of that, the introduction of laser and other energy-based devices (EBDs) has opened new financial opportunities for physicians. This set of circumstances has created an influx in competing technologies, manufacturers and various brands that can make it hard, especially for a novice clinic owner, to decide which aesthetic laser to acquire.\nThings to consider when purchasing an aesthetic laser device\nThere are many considerations that come into the process of deciding which aesthetic laser device. These include the following:\nAll of the above are highly important. However, aside from these objective questions comes the matter of what type of laser should the physician be looking for in the first place. Though this question might feel difficult to answer, the past few decades have shown that there are several types that are well established and are considered somewhat of a gold standard in aesthetic dermatology practice. These include the following aesthetic laser types:\nYou can find some of the above lasers, like the\xa0CO2 laser, mostly as standalone device. In this instance, a device designed to treat a different range of skin conditions. However, some\xa0are available both in standalone laser form and on multi-technology platforms as well. This poses a dilemma for some users which can be solved if you have the right information and through a simple thought process.\nStandalone machines vs. platform lasers\nIn many cases, standalone lasers tend to have a single wavelength and a small variety of applicators. These devices usually treat a narrow range of indications. That is one of the reasons why they are more favorable among experienced physicians who have an established practice. They simply have the privilege of focusing on certain areas of expertise. A younger clinic owner, one who is still building his or her reputation and clientele would prefer to acquire a more flexible device, that can answer the needs of all sorts of patients. These platforms offer several applicators, various laser types and sometimes even both laser and IPL or other light-based technology.\nGenerally speaking, standalone lasers tend to be more robust, and have the reputation of being “work horses”. Platform lasers on the other hand, are cheaper to own, require less office space and are a bit cheaper to maintain.\nThe Q-switched Nd: YAG laser is a very popular laser and a good example for a laser that can be found either as standalone or as part of a platform. Let’s use Two of Alma’s bestselling aesthetic laser devices for this comparison. The ALMA-Q laser and the Harmony XL Pro platform. We’ve asked Mr. Ohad Toledano, one of Alma’s clinical instructors for more insights on this comparison.\nHarmony XL Pro – Multi application platform\nThe Harmony XL Pro laser platform boasts various technologies – the Q-switched ND: Yag laser, the 2940nm ER: Yag laser, 1540nm ER: Glass laser and various IPL hand-pieces. It has 65 cleared FDA indications for treatment – is there a case of quantity over quality with such a device?\n“Absolutely not. The laser itself is almost as good as the\xa0standalone laser\xa0and differences are mostly not related to its clinical potential. For example, in Q-switched Nd:YAG laser, tattoo removal will be as effective in both. However, in a standalone laser, treatment time will be shorter and handling it will be more convenient. Yet, end results differ in lasers specifications such as pulse width rather than is it a standalone or platform. Secondly, if you use a platform laser, and don’t achieve the results you initially wanted, you can differ to a different technology (or wavelength). This means a seasoned user will be able to get better results by utilizing his experience.\nAn example for that can be choosing an ablative over a none ablative one, or IPL vs Laser. I admit there are rare specific cases (certain lesions) that might be best treated with only a specific laser type. However, with the platform the value you get by the wide variety and flexibility exceeds the value a standalone laser will give you by being great at treating something specific. To go back to the point made earlier in this article – for a beginner that hasn’t carved his or her niche yet – the platform is great because it enables them to gain more experience treating many skin conditions.”\nWhat are the benefits that standout to you in favor of a standalone laser device?\n“Within standalone lasers what you get is the robustness of the standalone and the higher peak power levels. In addition, standalone laser tends to last longer. A platform laser\xa0uses a hand-piece with a small laser rod positioned inside. You will have\xa0to be replace this laser rod periodically. The ALMA-Q also represents a more modern approach to standalone aesthetic lasers, as it features up to 7 different hand-pieces that gives it much more flexibility than traditional single devices. So even though it can still work at 1064nm or 532nm via the Q-switch, the specially designed hand-pieces broaden the range of its capabilities. In Addition, the ALMA-Q is unique in the sense that it has 3 different pulse duration settings (Nanosecond, Microsecond & Millisecond) which is highly unique for a Q-switched laser.”\nHave you had experience treating the same indication with both of these laser devices? What were your impressions?\n“Yes. We have been conducting in depth researches of laser\xa0tattoo removal\xa0and superficial pigment removal. ALMA-Q is faster than the Harmony XL Pro and has a larger spot size. Hence, the treatment time is shorter. That is especially great when removing large tattoos. Yet over all, the number of sessions needed to remove a tattoo or a pigment is the same.”\nAny advice for those who find it hard to decide?\n“I think firstly you as a practitioner must ask what are your goals? If a physician is focused on treating a specific field of interest, let’s say, vascular pigmentation, then I would suggest a standalone laser. One that focuses on that field of interest. Yet if he/she is seeking to cover as much indications as possible, attracting more clients, then a multi-technology will be the better choice.\nGenerally, we always advise physicians not to lose too much sleep over this matter. This is a growing industry, and many of them will have long and prosperous careers. That means they will get the chance to work with both kinds of devices and sometimes even simultaneously at their practice. Also, I always tell them to closely examine what kind of training does the company that sells the device offer. That is because even the best technology available is not worth much without the expertise of the practitioner.”\nRelated Products\nA powerful, multi-application platform for a wide range of aesthetic skin treatments\nThe ultimate offering, delivering remarkable results for a full range of body and...\nUnmatched power and versatility for treating a wide range of aesthetic dermal indications\nAchieve dramatic, age-defying results for multiple dermatological and surgical indications\nMore from Alma's Knowledge Booster\nComparing Soprano Laser Devices\nMany people call to ask what is the difference between the various Soprano laser devices available on the market.

The demand for lasers is projected to grow rapidly due to aging baby boomers and the prevalence of surplus income with the middle class to spend on cosmetic surgeries', 'score': 0.85843, 'raw_content': 'Aesthetic Lasers Market Size, Share & Trends Analysis Report By Application (IPL Laser Treatment, Laser Skin Resurfacing, Noninvasive Tightening, Laser-Assisted), By Region, And Segment Forecasts, 2022 - 2030\nReport Overview\nThe global aesthetic laser market size was estimated at USD 969.5 million in 2021 and is expected to expand at a CAGR of 16.6% from 2022 to 2030. The demand for lasers is projected to grow rapidly due to aging baby boomers and the prevalence of surplus income with the middle class to spend on cosmetic surgeries. The outbreak of COVID-19 led many aesthetic facilities to completely halt their services and permanently cancel appointments as they were considered non-essential and high contact in nature. Surgical aesthetic treatments like aesthetic laser treatments also witnessed a setback and the number of procedures declined majorly in the first and second quarters of 2020 due to the pandemic.\nThe increasing popularity of radiofrequency-based treatments is also driving the aesthetic Laser market. Radiofrequency-based devices, such as Picoway, LaseMD, FraxPro, and Pixel CO2 are gaining popularity as they are completely non-invasive and also have proven effective in treating different skin conditions. PicoWay, manufactured by Candela Medical, is a picosecond laser platform delivering high peak power and ultra-short pulse durations for a photoacoustic effect. The platform is used to treat Pigmented lesions, skin rejuvenation & toning, and tattoo removal.\nTechnological advancement in the field of laser technology has resulted in greater treatment outcomes and high patient satisfaction. For instance, In March 2020, Lumenis introduced an intelligent skin innovative platform called the Stellar M22. It is a multi-application platform that is made to treat over 30 skin conditions like vascular lesions, uneven skin texture, acne, sagging skin and hair removal, etc. This device is gaining popularity among practitioners as it can safely and effectively treat different indications in different skin types, ages, and gender.\nThe increase in social media exposure has led to a rise in aesthetic awareness and different aesthetic treatments available in the market. This has led the global population to constantly focus on appearing young. According to the United Nations in 2019, there were 703 million people aged 65 & over in the world 2019 and the number of elderly people is projected to double to 1.5 billion by 2050. Therefore, the geriatric population, intending to minimize the signs of aging are opting for anti-aging and skin tightening laser procedures that have a high success rate, low downtime, and high patient comfort.\nThe demand for minimally invasive treatments has gained popularity in recent years. Such surgeries offer advantages including smaller incisions, rapid wound healing, lesser pain, fewer surgical wounds, and a lower risk of complications as compared to invasive surgeries. Moreover, the effectiveness and results of currently available minimally invasive surgeries are similar to conventional surgical treatments. In 2020, around 1,837,052 hair removal procedures were carried out globally as per the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery.\nThe pandemic affected the global aesthetic industry as it is a high contact service and therefore, governments in many countries mandated temporary shutdowns of aesthetic facilities. The third and fourth quarters of 2020 witnessed ease in lockdowns and many plastic surgeons and aesthetic centers started taking in appointments and consultations but with strict guidelines and limited patients per day.\nHowever, the market is expected to recover from the effect of the pandemic, as the American Society of Plastic Surgeons stated, there is pent-up patient demand for non-invasive treatments post-pandemic. Treatments like hair removal and total facial rejuvenation treatments witnessed +76.1% and 13.9% growth in 2020 as compared to 2019 implying high adoption of aesthetic treatments globally.\nApplication Type Insights\nThe non-invasive tightening segment held the largest market share of 29.1% in 2021 in the aesthetic laser market. Based on application, the segment is divided into IPL laser treatment, laser skin resurfacing, non-invasive tightening, laser-assisted lipoplasty, and laser hair removal. The rising baby boomers population and the growing influence of social media have affected both the old and young respectively. The aging population opts for procedures such as skin tightening and resurfacing.\nLaser skin resurfacing is expected to witness the highest CAGR of 17.5% during the forecast period. This is because laser resurfacing is currently one of the most frequently performed procedures for skin rejuvenation. Some common conditions that skin rejuvenation addresses are wrinkles, acne scars, facial pigmentation, vascular conditions, and dull skin.\nThe laser hair removal segment will also witness significant growth during the forecast period. According to the 2020 Plastic Surgery Statistics Report, around 757,808 laser hair removal procedures were performed across the U.S., and it was among the topmost performed non-surgical procedures. Furthermore, the availability of compact and portable systems is driving the market. In addition, the introduction of system components that can be upgraded with an advanced user interface without changing the entire unit is impelling segment growth.\nRegional Insights\nNorth America held the largest market share of 38.6% of the market in 2021. North America registered a significant share of the market in 2021 owing to the presence of a large number of skilled professionals and significant awareness among people in the region regarding the advancement in aesthetic procedures. The market is majorly driven by the introduction of advanced technologies and huge investments of industry players in research and development to improve the existing technology and make it safer and more effective.\nA growing number of surgeons in the region, increasing spending power of consumers, and a growing number of research activities in the domain are a few other factors for the growth of the market in North America. In addition, increasing adoption of modern technologies and rising efforts for the promotion of non-invasive aesthetic treatments are predicted to affect the growth of the market in the region.\nThe Asia Pacific region is anticipated to witness the highest growth rate during the forecast period owing to the growing opportunities in medical tourism. People with a huge awareness of aesthetic procedures are also expected to contribute to the high growth of this regional segment over the forecast period. Developing economies, such as India are witnessing high willingness and desire among the population to under aesthetic treatments. In 2020, around 70,416 facial rejuvenation procedures were carried out in India, According to the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery. Moreover, growing medical tourism in emerging countries is expected to drive the market in the region.\nKey Companies & Market Share Insights\nPrimary parameters affecting the competitive nature include rapid adoption of advanced devices for improved treatment and technological advancements. In addition, to retain shares and diversify product portfolios, major players are frequently undertaking mergers & acquisitions. For Instance, In January 2020, Alma Lasers announced the launch of ClearSkin PRO, a non-ablative erbium applicator used in skin remodeling and skin resurfacing.\nPlayers are also focusing on geographical expansion and regulatory approvals in growing economies, especially Asian countries which are currently witnessing high demand for aesthetic treatments. For instance, In July 2020, InMode Ltd received clearance for its two proprietary InMode radiofrequency platforms (InMode RF platform and the InMode platform) from the China National Medical Products Administration NMPA.

Dermatologists are now able to treat skin conditions that were once considered incurable. On top of that, the introduction of laser and other energy-based devices (EBDs) has opened new financial opportunities for physicians. This set of circumstances has created an influx in competing technologies, manufacturers and various brands that can make it hard, especially for a novice clinic owner, to decide which aesthetic laser to acquire.\nDr. Reyes of @cdipanama with her Harmony XL Pro laser platform\nThings to consider when purchasing an aesthetic laser device\nThere are many considerations that come into the process of deciding which aesthetic laser device. These include the following:\nAll of the above are highly important. All of the above are highly important. However, aside from these objective questions comes the matter of what type of laser should the physician be looking for in the first place. Though this question might feel difficult to answer, the past few decades have shown that there are several types that are well established and are considered somewhat of a gold standard in aesthetic dermatology practice. These include the following aesthetic laser types:\nYou can find some of the above lasers, like the CO2 laser, mostly as standalone device. In this instance, a device designed to treat a different range of skin conditions. However, some\xa0are available both in standalone laser form and on multi-technology platforms as well. This poses a dilemma for some users which can be solved if you have the right information and through a simple thought process.\nThe Arion Alexandrite 755nm standalone laser hair removal device, photo by @Feliciamed_Athens\nStandalone machines vs. platform lasers\nIn many cases, standalone lasers tend to have a single wavelength and a small variety of applicators. These devices usually treat a narrow range of indications. That is one of the reasons why they are more favorable among experienced physicians who have an established practice. They simply have the privilege of focusing on certain areas of expertise. A younger clinic owner, one who is still building his or her reputation and clientele would prefer to acquire a more flexible device, that can answer the needs of all sorts of patients. These platforms offer several applicators, various laser types and sometimes even both laser and IPL or other light-based technology.\nGenerally speaking, standalone lasers tend to be more robust, and have the reputation of being “work horses”. Platform lasers on the other hand, are cheaper to own, require less office space and are a bit cheaper to maintain.\nThe Q-switched Nd: YAG laser is a very popular laser and a good example for a laser that can be found either as standalone or as part of a platform. Let’s use Two of Alma’s bestselling aesthetic laser devices for this comparison. The ALMA-Q laser and the Harmony XL Pro platform. We’ve asked Mr. Ohad Toledano, one of Alma’s clinical instructors for more insights on this comparison.\nQ-\xa0The Harmony XL Pro laser platform boasts various technologies – the Q-switched ND: Yag laser, the 2940nm ER: Yag laser, 1540nm ER: Glass laser and various IPL hand-pieces. It has 65 cleared FDA indications for treatment – is there a case of quantity over quality with such a device?\n“Absolutely not. The laser itself is almost as good as the standalone laser and differences are mostly not related to its clinical potential. For example, in Q-switched Nd:YAG laser, tattoo removal will be as effective in both. However, in a standalone laser, treatment time will be shorter and handling it will be more convenient. Yet, end results differ in lasers specifications such as pulse width rather than is it a standalone or platform. Secondly, if you use a platform laser, and don’t achieve the results you initially wanted, you can differ to a different technology (or wavelength). This means a seasoned user will be able to get better results by utilizing his experience.\nAn example for that can be choosing an ablative over a none ablative one, or IPL vs Laser. I admit there are rare specific cases (certain lesions) that might be best treated with only a specific laser type. However, with the platform the value you get by the wide variety and flexibility exceeds the value a standalone laser will give you by being great at treating something specific. To go back to the point made earlier in this article – for a beginner that hasn’t carved his or her niche yet – the platform is great because it enables them to gain more experience treating many skin conditions.”\nA display of few of the hand-pieces available with Harmony XL Pro, photo courtesy of @pulse_laser, UK\nQ – What are the benefits that standout to you in favor of a standalone laser device?\n“Within standalone lasers what you get is the robustness of the standalone and the higher peak power levels. In addition, standalone laser tends to last longer. A platform laser\xa0uses a hand-piece with a small laser rod positioned inside. You will have\xa0to be replace this laser rod periodically. The ALMA-Q also represents a more modern approach to standalone aesthetic lasers, as it features up to 7 different hand-pieces that gives it much more flexibility than traditional single devices. So even though it can still work at 1064nm or 532nm via the Q-switch, the specially designed hand-pieces broaden the range of its capabilities. In Addition, the ALMA-Q is unique in the sense that it has 3 different pulse duration settings (Nanosecond, Microsecond & Millisecond) which is highly unique for a Q-switched laser.”\nQ – Have you had experience treating the same indication with both of these laser devices? What were your impressions?\n“Yes. We have been conducting in depth researches of laser tattoo removal and superficial pigment removal. ALMA-Q is faster than the Harmony XL Pro and has a larger spot size. Hence, the treatment time is shorter. That is especially great when removing large tattoos. Yet over all, the number of sessions needed to remove a tattoo or a pigment is the same.”\nQ – Any advice for those who find it hard to decide?\n“I think firstly you as a practitioner must ask what are your goals? If a physician is focused on treating a specific field of interest, let’s say, vascular pigmentation, then I would suggest a standalone laser. One that focuses on that field of interest. Yet if he/she is seeking to cover as much indications as possible, attracting more clients, then a multi-technology will be the better choice.\nGenerally, we always advise physicians not to lose too much sleep over this matter. This is a growing industry, and many of them will have long and prosperous careers. That means they will get the chance to work with both kinds of devices and sometimes even simultaneously at their practice. Also, I always tell them to closely examine what kind of training does the company that sells the device offer.
